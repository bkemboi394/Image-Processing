# Image-Processing

C++ coding algorithms behind convolution filters, luminosity, rotation, reflection etc. in Image Processing applications from scratch.

This was a class project for a High Performance Computing class that I am taking that I found really interesting, so I decided to explore it more.

The code for reading and writing out the image pixels was provided.

We were required to write code that achieves at least one image processing task, but I found the project interesting and decided to explore more than just one task, and have so far achieved the mentioned 4 above. 

The main focus of the project was to investigate how parallel programming with OpenMp optimizes such tasks, especially where large images are involved. That explains the timing part and the ' #pragma omp parallel for' syntax.

I compiled and executed the program via a virtual c++ lab environment provided by my school for HPC students. 

Tested out the code on a picture taken somewhere in our school named 'GVSU.pgm'

Since I couldn't upload my image results successfully, I screenshoted them and pasted them on a word document, converted the word document to a pdf file and pushed it as an output file above.
